## Introduction

Detecting temporal signals of a phylogenetic tree is crucial for estimating divergence times and ccan also serve as a data quality control measure before applying molecular clock models. The `r CRANpkg("shinyTempSignal")` package implemntes temporal signal analysis under both strict and relaxed molecular clock assumptions and allows exploring temporal signals across the entire tree as well as within different lineages. 

ShinyTempSignal allows regression analysis of various types of data, including measurable biological traits and statistical values obtained from evolutionary analysis. Such a versatile regression analysis is highly beneficial for discovering potential evolutionary patterns and addressing biological questions.

Implementing using R shiny, `r CRANpkg("shinyTempSignal")` provides an interactive interface that allows users to visualize analysis results in real-time and explore data easily.

## Installation

`r CRANpkg('shinyTemnpSignal')` is available in CRAN and user can use the following command to install it:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("shinyTempSignal")
```


## Run the shiny application

After loading the package, users can use the ` run_shinyTempSignal()` command to launch the shiny application.


```{r eval=FALSE}
library(shinyTemnpSignal)
run_shinyTempSignal()
```

## Interactive Web Interface


### Tree structure exploration panel

![**Exploring tree structure.** Users need to upload a tree file and a corresponding regular expression to extract sampling dates from tip labels through steps (1-5); users can modify the tree plot appearance (6) and select using temporal or phylogenetic signals for detecting outliers (7) which will be shown in a different color of tip points; different panels (8-11) can be selected to present different analysis results.](figures/Figure1.png){width=100%}

### Sample date panel

![**Exploring sampling dates.** This panel is used to present the sampling dates extracted from the tip labels of the tree and the divergence from the tip to the root will also be calculated.](figures/Figure2.png){width=100%}


### Temporal signal panel

![**Exploring temporal signal.** This panel displays the root-to-tip regression. Clicking the `autodel` button will delete outliers automatically, and clicking the `Reset` button will restore the original tree. Users can choose an interesting clade by entering a selected node number in the `node` text box. The regression equation is displayed in the regression plot, and the corresponding statistics including the intercept, slope, and R-squared will be presented in a table next to the plot.](figures/Figure3.png){width=100%}


### Phylogenetic signal panel

![**Exploring phylogenetic signal.** This panel works if users upload corresponding external data. It performs phylogenetic signal analysis that is similar to temporal signal analysis. Users are allowed to select variables for regression analysis. ](figures/Figure4.png){width=100%}
